Square LED matrices that look 'round _(with apologies to Roald Dahl)_.

I wanted to do a project to start hacking on AVRs and multiplexing LEDs. So, here's what I came up with.

Originally, my plan was to mount the eyes on a pumpkin and cover it with a fabric mask. Instead, I'm thinking of putting it in a small cigar-like box with the same black fabric and prop the box top open as if the creepy crawly is looking out.

Hardware list (major parts):
* Atmel ATMega168 AVR
* 2 Maxim MAX7219 Display Drivers
* 2 Luckylight 3mm 8x8 Dot Matrix LED Displays
